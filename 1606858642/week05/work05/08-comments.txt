- The program is about memory allocation using malloc.
- Malloc is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap.
- Because malloc is a dynamic memory allocation the memory is more explicitly managed. 
- The program allocate the specified number of bytes.
- Like in the program: 
                    chrStr=malloc(MSIZE1);
  means that number of bytes of MSIZE1 which is 0x10000 occupy in memory,
  then requests that many bytes from malloc and then assigns the result to a chrStr.
- And 
                    free (chrStr); 
  means that when a program no longer needs the dynamic chrStr, it should call
  free to return the memory it occupies to the free store.so it can be used for
  other purposes.
