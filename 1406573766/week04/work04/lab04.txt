The code on 00-global-char.c puts the variable declarations outside of the main() function, making them global variables. On the other hand, the variable declations on 00-local-char.c is inside the main() function, making them local variables.

The number on their address differs greatly because they are  

A local variable is visible only within the block of code in which it appears. It has meaning only within the function block it was declared in.

A global variable can be accessed from anywhere within the code.

Pointer variable contains the address to a variable, whereas other variable types typically contains the value within the variable itself.

To make pointer variable, you need to extract the address value from the target variable by placing an ampersand(&) as a prefix, then place them into your pointer variable.

O_CREAT will create a new file if it does not exist. The new file will be named after the argument in the parameter.

O_RDWR means that the user can edit the file.

S_IRWXU means that the file owner has read, write and execute permission

S_IRGRP and S_IWGRP respectively means that the group has read and write permission

S_IROTH means that others have read, write and execute permission

open and close I/O process will switch the destination of output. Normally, the output destination is the command line itself. However, we can make a file to be the destination simply by passing the file name as the parameter.
